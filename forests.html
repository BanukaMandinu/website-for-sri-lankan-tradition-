            <h3>Kanneliya Forest </h3><br>
            <img src="/Images/Kanneliya.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Kanneliya Forest Reserve Experience the feeling of walking in a tropical rain forest . . . The KDN Forest Reserve (Kanneliya-Dediyagama-Nakiyadeniya) is the second largest primary forest area in Sri Lanka and is renowned for its watershed value. The forest occupies the area between two rivers - the Gin Ganga and the Nilwala Ganga. The natural vegetation of the KDN complex is lowland wet evergreen forest, which is a climax forest formation dominated by an association of Shorea, Dipterocarpus and Mesua. Over 17% of the wet zone flora is confined to this area where the KDN forest is the most prominent. This region has been identified as one of the floristically richest areas in South Asia. The endemic flora and fauna of the southwestern wet zone, including the KDN, forms a relic of the biota of the Indian Plate with Gondwanaic ancestry. Therefore, the biota of southwest Sri Lanka, including the KDN forest complex, is of considerable scientific interest with respect to biogeography. There is a high proportion of endemism amongst the identified woody plants, with 150 species being endemic to Sri Lanka. There are 78 villages surrounding the KDN forest complex. There are small-scale cottage industries based on Fish-tail palm (Kitul), and many local people are involved in the collection of medicinal plants and plant products, as well as rattan, to produce handicrafts and furniture. What can be seen:- Over 100 bird species, 16 of which are endemic to Sri Lanka (such as the Green-billed Coucal, Blue Magpie and Spot-winged Thrush). Over 15 species of endemic fresh-water fish. Many other endemic reptiles, amphibians and butterflies can also be see in the area.</p>

The park is best known for its variety of wildlife. It is important conservation of Sri Lankan elephants, Sri Lankan leopards and aquatic birds.
                There are six national parks and three wildlife sanctuaries in the vicinity of Yala. Among the largest is Lunugamvehera National Park. The park is situated in the dry semi-arid climatic region and rain is received mainly during the northeast monsoon. Yala hosts a variety of ecosystems ranging from moist monsoon forests to freshwater and marine wetlands. It is one of the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Yala harbors 215 bird species including six endemic species of Sri Lanka. The number of mammals that has been recorded from the park is 44, and it has one of the highest leopard densities in the world.
                The area around Yala has hosted several ancient civilizations. Two important Buddhist pilgrim sites, Sithulpahuwa and Magul Vihara, are situated within the park.

            <p>Wilpattu National Park is a national park in Sri Lanka. The unique feature of this park is the existence of "Willus" (natural lakes) – natural, sand-rimmed water basins or depressions that fill with rainwater. Located on the northwest coast lowland dry zone of Sri Lanka, the park is 30 km (19 mi) west of Anuradhapura and 26 km (16 mi) north of Puttalam (approximately 180 km (110 mi) north of Colombo). The park is 1,317 km2 (508 sq mi) (131,693 hectares) in area and ranges from 0–152 m (0–499 ft) above sea level. Nearly one hundred and six lakes (Willu) and tanks are found spread throughout Wilpattu. Wilpattu is the largest and one of the oldest national parks in Sri Lanka. Wilpattu is world-renowned for its leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) population. A remote camera survey conducted in Wilpattu from July to October 2015 by the Wilderness and Wildlife Conservation Trust captured photographs of forty-nine individual leopards in the surveyed area, the core area density of which was between that of Yala National Park's Block I and Horton Plains National Park.
                From December 1988 to 16 March 2003, the park was closed due to security concerns surrounding the Sri Lankan Civil War, before being reopened to visitors sixteen years later. Visitor access is currently limited to approximately 25% of the park, the remainder of which is dense forest or scrub.

            <h3>Knuckles Forest Reserve</h3><br>
            <img src="/Images/Knuckles_Forest_Reserve.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The Knuckles Mountain Range also called the Knuckles Massif; a bio-diversity hotspot located in the districts of Kandy and Matale in the Central Province of Sri Lanka. Situated at a height of over 3000 ft above sea level, covering a land area of approximately 21 ha it consists of five peaks; namely Kirigalpottha, Gombaniya, Knuckles, Koboneelagala and Dotulugala which form the shape of the knuckles in a clenched fist. The area situated above 1500 m was declared a climatic reserve in 1873 and a conservation forest in 2000, later a National Man & Biosphere Reserve and a World Heritage Site in 2009. It is today considered as one of South Asia’s important sites for the conservation of montane tropical forest habitats.

                This picturesque mist laden mountain range is where the Knuckles Forest Reserve also known as the Knuckles Conservation forest is found. It is an UNESCO designated World Heritage Site that comes under the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka’s World Heritage Property, one of the two World Heritage Natural Properties in Sri Lanka.

                The climate here varies from hot to very wet and cold with some higher elevations reporting ground frost during January – March with strong winds at most other times. The vegetation in the valleys and foothills consist mainly of semi evergreen vegetation with large trees, the upper slopes contain tropical montane humid evergreen rain forest and the upper levels possess cloud forests; a moist forest with a low-level cloud cover where various endemic species of ferns, orchids, lichens and mosses grow profusely. The other types of unique vegetation found here includes the distinctively beautiful grasslands called “Pitawala Patana”, the picturesque Riverine forests alongside the rivers and waterways, the Scrublands and the Pygmy forests with its twisted and gnarled plant life that grow up to 1-2 m from ground level.

                The Knuckles massif separates itself from the central hills by the Dumbara Valley; a deep gorge. There are several trails to the Knuckles Mountain range, each one different and exclusive, making it ideal for hiking, trekking, waterfall hunting, bird watching and certainly a must place for some scenic photography. Visitors can travel on three routes from Kandy via Rattota, via Wattegama and via Teldeniya.

                The Knuckles Forest reserve is considered a vital water catchment with many of its streams feeding important downstream rivers such as the gigantic Mahaweli River (the country’s longest), the Heen River, Maha Oya, Hasalaka Oya and the Theligamu Oya.
